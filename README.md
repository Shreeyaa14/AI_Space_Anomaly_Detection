# AI-based Space Situational Awareness (SSA) System
AI-based Space Situational Awareness (SSA) system for real-time orbital monitoring, anomaly detection, and trajectory prediction. It uses LSTM, Kalman Filters, HMMs, and reinforcement learning to enable autonomous collision avoidance with improved accuracy and efficiency.

This project proposes an AI-driven SSA framework that enables real-time anomaly detection, trajectory prediction, and collision avoidance through advanced machine learning techniques. The system continuously monitors key orbital parameters such as rotation rate, angular velocity, trajectory patterns, axis tilt, and motion dynamics using multi-sensor data fusion.
Deep learning and probabilistic models including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Kalman Filters, and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are employed for accurate trajectory forecasting and anomaly detection. In addition, reinforcement learning (RL) enables autonomous decision-making for orbital maneuvers and collision mitigation. The framework also integrates cybersecurity mechanisms to protect satellite communication networks from potential cyber threats.
Simulation results demonstrate a 98% anomaly detection accuracy, a 65% reduction in collision probability, and a 30% improvement in computational efficiency compared to conventional SSA approaches. These outcomes validate the effectiveness of AI-based SSA as a scalable and adaptive solution for future space traffic management, enhancing orbital safety, sustainability, and autonomous space operations.
